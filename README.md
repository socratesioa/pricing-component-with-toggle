## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use pure CSS to display content based on the checkbox input.

### Continued development

Normally I would attempt to solve this challenge by using javascript for the toggle. But accepting the bonus challenge I wanted to do it with just HTML and CSS. I managed to do this and in doing so I learned a lot about CSS combinators.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/) - This helped me understand how I can use CSS to display different elements based on the checkbox input.
